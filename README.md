# Summary

Sure! Here’s a polished, professional summary of your Netflix Power BI project without referencing the STAR method explicitly:

---

I independently worked on a Netflix dataset to uncover insights using data storytelling and business intelligence techniques. 

The goal was to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes key aspects of Netflix's content library,

including content types, viewer ratings, country of origin, and yearly trends.

Using Power Query, I cleaned and transformed the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency. 

I then built custom DAX measures to track performance indicators such as total titles,

distribution by type, top contributing countries, rating breakdowns, and genre trends. 

The dashboard was designed with user interactivity in mind—featuring slicers, filters, 

and clear visuals to help users explore insights from multiple perspectives.

The result is a dynamic, professional-grade report that enables stakeholders to understand Netflix’s content strategy at a glance. 

It demonstrates practical skills in data modeling, visualization, and insight delivery, aligning closely with real-world business intelligence use cases.
